        their own name. Suppose we need to find someone on any social media
        website such as Facebook, Instagram etc. To do so we need to go on

        on social media. Sherlock searches for usernames between 300 websites of
        social media and provides the related link of that social media
        platform. Sherlock is written in python language.
